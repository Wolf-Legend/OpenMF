## Project Overview
OpenMF is an open source forensic tool for Android smartphones that helps digital forensic investigators throughout the life cycle of digital forensic investigation.

For e.g. let us say we have a crime scene in which we have captured some suspects and we have their mobile phones. If we want to extract all the data from their phones and see which of them are actually involved in the crime scene then we require a software to perform this task and produce Meaningful evidence and Analysis report for every phone (Digital forensic case).
The OpenMF project is a dedicated software to:
1) Extract the relevant data
2) Manage all the cases separately
3) Produce Analysis report

This open source project is an important tool for Digital forensic organization.
At present OpenMF is only a commmand line tool but we are planing to make a complete web client with additional features like Admin, Management and Extractor. These roles will have different privileges to the tool and as a whole it will become a complete open source forensic tool for Android smartphones which then can be used by any Digital digital forensic investigation organization.
